#  🛡️ Totally Real "Hacker" Page [CLOSED]
[![Status: Deactivated] 
Link: https://shireesh14.github.io/fun/

A front-end experiment/prank that simulates a system breach. Designed to startle the user for 9 seconds before revealing a harmless message.

## 🚀 Overview
This project uses vanilla **HTML5**, **CSS3 animations**, and **JavaScript** to create a high-urgency environment. It was deployed via GitHub Pages for a quick, one-time execution.

### ✨ Features
*   **Visual Urgency**: Uses `@keyframes flash` and `shake` effects to simulate system instability.
*   **Dynamic UI**: A JavaScript-driven countdown synchronized with "hacking" status messages.
*   **Particle System**: A custom lightweight `confetti()` function written in pure JS (no external libraries).
*   **Responsive**: Viewport-based units (`vw`/`vh`) ensure the "scare" looks good on both mobile and desktop.

## 📁 File Structure
*   `index.html` - Core logic and UI.
*   `left.png`, `rigth.png`, `bottom.png`, `top.png` - Visual assets for the breach overlay.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6).
*   **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (Currently Disabled).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This repository is for **educational and entertainment purposes only**. It contains no malicious code and does not access user data. It is a simulation of a UI/UX "scare" tactic.
